# Workspaces

Workspaces are a powerful way to organize your workflows into separate environments, which you can tailor and optimize.

## Workspace Switcher

The primary mechanism to interact with workspaces is via the Workspace Switcher, located to the left of the tab bar.

This is where you can create a new workspace, edit how a workspace entry appears, and delete a workspace.

The Workspace Switcher button changes to display the icon and color of the active workspace. If the current workspace is not saved, it will display the <WorkspaceSVG/> icon.

## Creating a new workspace

Every new window is initialized with a blank workspace containing a single tab with a single terminal block inside it.
