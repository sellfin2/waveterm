# Wave Terminal

Wave is an open-source AI-native terminal built for seamless workflows.

Wave isn't just another terminal emulator; it's a rethink on how terminals are built. Wave combines command line with the power of the open web to help veteran CLI users and new developers alike.

-   Inline renderers to cut down on context switching. Render code, images, markdown, and CSV files without ever leaving the terminal.
-   Persistent sessions that can restore state across network disconnections and reboots
-   Searchable contextual command history across all remote sessions (saved locally)
-   Workspaces, tabs, and command blocks to keep you organized
-   CodeEdit, to edit local and remote files with a VSCode-like inline editor
-   AI Integration with ChatGPT (or ChatGPT compatible APIs) to help write commands and get answers inline
